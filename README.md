# Arduino library for the Apple Remote

The [Apple Remote][1] is a remote control device that can be used to send
instructions to a variety of Apple products, such as the Apple TV.

The primary purpose of this library is to emit [Apple Remote][1] infrared
pulses that mimic those produced by the [Apple Remote][1] using an
Arduino-compatible board and an IR LED

```arduino
#include <AppleRemote.h>

// PWM~ PIN (an IR LED)
#define PIN_IR_OUTPUT 3

AppleRemote *appleRemote;

void setup() {
  // We can pass either APPLE_REMOTE_MODEL_A or APPLE_REMOTE_MODEL_B to define
  // the Apple Remote model we want to use.
  appleRemote = new AppleRemote(PIN_IR_OUTPUT, APPLE_REMOTE_MODEL_A);
}

void loop() {
  // Sends the IR signal that corresponds to the menu button in the Apple
  // Remote.
  appleRemote->Menu();
  delay(10000);
}
```

This Arduino library can also recognize [Apple Remote][1] pulses sent by an
actual controller with a little help from [IRDump][2] and an IR receiver.

## Usage

```c++
class AppleRemote {
private:
  /* Omitted */

public:
  AppleRemote(int pin, int model);

  void Menu();
  void Right();
  void Left();
  void Up();
  void Down();
  void Play();
  void Center();
  void Repeat();

  int Match(unsigned int *);
};
```

## Example project
