# Arduino library for the Apple Remote control

The [Apple Remote][1] is a remote control device that can be used to send
instructions to a variety of Apple products, such as the Apple TV.

The primary purpose of this library is to emit [Apple Remote][1] infrared
pulses that mimic those produced by the [Apple Remote][1] using an
Arduino-compatible board and an IR LED

This Arduino library can also recognize [Apple Remote][1] pulses with a little
help from [IRDump][2] and an IR receiver.

## Sending a pulse

### Hardware

1. An Arduino board
2. An IR LED
3. A 220 ohm resistor

### Instructions

1. Connect the short leg of the IR LED to the Arduino's GND through the 220 ohm
   resistor.
2. Connect the other leg to the the Arduino's digital pin #3.
3. Bend the LED gently so its top faces an Apple device with an IR sensor, such
   an Apple TV.

### Code

```arduino
#include <AppleRemote.h>

// PWM~ PIN (an IR LED)
#define PIN_IR_OUTPUT 3

AppleRemote *appleRemote;

void setup() {
  // We can pass either APPLE_REMOTE_MODEL_A or APPLE_REMOTE_MODEL_B to define
  // the Apple Remote model we want to use.
  appleRemote = new AppleRemote(PIN_IR_OUTPUT, APPLE_REMOTE_MODEL_A);
}

void loop() {
  // Sends the IR signal that corresponds to the menu button in the Apple
  // Remote.
  appleRemote->Menu();
  delay(10000);
}
```

## How to install

Create new a folder named `MakerWorkshop` within the Arduino's library folder.
If you're on a Mac it should be `Documents/Arduino/libraries/` on Linux it
probably would be in `/usr/share/arduino/libraries/`. If that folder already
exists you don't need to create it again.

Download and uncompress the latest [.ZIP package][4], a folder named
`arduino_apple_remote-master` will be created, rename the uncompressed folder
to `arduino_apple_remote` and put it into your recently created `MakerWorkshop`
folder.

That's all! this library should be ready to use in your projects now. See the
Arduino's documentation on [importing libraries][3] whenever you're in doubt.

## Quick start

See the [example project][1] for a quick start and wiring diagrams.
