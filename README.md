# Arduino library for the Apple Remote control

The primary purpose of this library is to emit [Apple Remote][1] infrared
pulses using an Arduino-compatible board and an IR LED.

This library can also recognize [Apple Remote][1] pulses with a little help
from [IRDump][2] and an IR receiver.

## Sending a pulse

```arduino
#include <AppleRemote.h>

// The PWM~ PIN number that is connected to an IR LED
#define PIN_IR_OUTPUT 3

AppleRemote *appleRemote;

void setup() {
  // We can pass either APPLE_REMOTE_MODEL_A or APPLE_REMOTE_MODEL_B to define
  // the Apple Remote model we want to use.
  appleRemote = new AppleRemote(PIN_IR_OUTPUT, APPLE_REMOTE_MODEL_A);
}

void loop() {
  appleRemote->Menu();
  delay(10000);
}
```

## How to install

Create new a folder named `MakerWorkshop` within the Arduino's library folder.
If you're on a Mac it should be `Documents/Arduino/libraries/` on Linux it
probably would be in `/usr/share/arduino/libraries/`. If that folder already
exists you don't need to create it again.

Download and uncompress the latest [.ZIP package][4], a folder named
`arduino_apple_remote-master` will be created, rename the uncompressed folder
to `arduino_apple_remote` and put it into your recently created `MakerWorkshop`
folder.

That's all! this library should be ready to use in your projects now. See the
Arduino's documentation on [importing libraries][3] whenever you're in doubt.

## Quick start

See the [example project][1] for a quick start and wiring diagrams.
