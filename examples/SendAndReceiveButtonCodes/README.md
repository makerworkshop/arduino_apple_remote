# Example project for the Apple Remote library for Arduino

This is an example project for the [Apple Remote][1] library. Throughout this
example you'll learn how to use the library to print the name of the pressed
button into the screen.

## Hardware

We're going to use the same hardware setup that we used for the [IRDump
example][3].

## Software

### Prerequisites

1. [Arduino IDE 1.6+][4].

### Getting up a project copy

1. Install the [IRDump][2] and the [AppleRemote][1] libraries.
2. Open the `SendAndReceiveButtonCodes.ino` file with the Arduino IDE.
3. Verify and upload the code to the board.
4. Click the "Serial Monitor" command in the Arduino's IDE tools menu to bring
   on the serial monitor.
5. Change the baud rate to `115200 baud`.

Point a remote controller to the IR sensor and press any key. You'll see the
name of the button you pressed printed in the serial console.
